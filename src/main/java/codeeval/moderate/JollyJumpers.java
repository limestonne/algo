 *
 * A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values
 * of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n - 1. eg.
 * 1 4 2 3
 *
 * is a jolly jumper, because the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
 * The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper.
 *
 * Write a program to determine whether each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.
