/**
 * We are given 3 strings: str1, str2, and str3. Str3 is said to be a shuffle
 * of str1 and str2 if it can be formed by interleaving the characters
 * of str1 and str2 in a way that maintains the left to right ordering
 * of the characters from each string.
 *
 * For example, given str1=”abc” and str2=”def”, str3=”dabecf” is a valid shuffle
 * since it preserves the character ordering of the two strings.
 * So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects
 * whether str3 is a valid shuffle of str1 and str2.
