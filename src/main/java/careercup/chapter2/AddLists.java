 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list,
 * where each node contains a single digit.
 * The digits are stored in reverse order,
 * such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list.
 * Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
 * Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
