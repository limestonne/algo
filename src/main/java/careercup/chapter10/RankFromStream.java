/**
 * Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers.
 * Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x (the number
 * of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data structures and algorithms
 * to support these operations. That is, implement the method track(int x),
 * which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x),
 * which returns the number of values <= x (not including x itself).
 *
 * Example:
 * Stream (in order of appearance): 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
 * getRankOfNumber(1) = 0
 * getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
 * getRankOfNumber(4) = 3
