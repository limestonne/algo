Questions for daily check
---

Below are some quite simple yet fundamental questions that can be solved in 15-20 minutes.

Just pick one or two and solve with pen and paper.

#### Arrays

1. "Array pair sum": find two numbers in an array, that sum up to a given value k.
2. A and B are sorted arrays and A has large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Merge B into A.

#### String

1. Convert string to number. Think carefully about what may come in input data.
2. Print all duplicates in a string.
2. Check if 2 strings are anagrams, for example: `(abba, baab)`.
3. Generate all permutations of a string.
4. Assuming you have method `isSubstring()` and two strings `s1` and `s2`, check if `s1` is rotation of string `s2`.
  Example: `waterbottle -> erbottlewat`
5. Check if a string has all unique characters. *Follow up: no additional buffers allowed.*
6. Implement basic string compression like `aabccccaaa -> a2b1c4a3`.
7. Reverse words in a string: `Hello, world! -> world! Hello!`
8. Find minimum distance between words in an array. 
  For example: `{"a", "c", "d", "a", "b"}`. 
  `dist("a", "b")=1, dist("b", "d")=2`.

#### Search and Sort

1. Binary search
2. Sort an array of strings, so that all the anagrams are next to each other.
3. There are 2 sorted arrays A and B. A has large enough buffer at the end to hold B. 
  Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
4. Bubble sort
5. Insertion sort

#### Binary Tree

1. In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversals.
2. Level-order traversal. *Follow up: print nodes level by level, like reverted tree.*
3. Check if a tree is BST.
4. Check if a tree is balanced.
5. Find the next node (in-order successor) of a given node in a BST. Each node has link to its parent.

#### Linked List

1. Delete node from the middle of a singly-linked list, having access only to that node. 
  Example: node `c` from `a->b->c->d->e->f`.
2. Remove duplicates from an unsorted singly-linked list. *Follow up: using no additional buffers*.
3. Check if a linked list is circular.
4. Find the n-th to last element of a singly linked list.
5. Check if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.
