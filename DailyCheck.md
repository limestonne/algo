Questions for daily check
---

#### String

1. Print all duplicates in a string
2. Check if 2 strings are anagrams (abba, baab) 
3. Generate all permutations of a string
4. Assuming you have method `isSubstring()` and two strings `s1` and `s2`, check if `s1` is rotation of string `s2`.
  Example: waterbottle -> erbottlewat
5. Check if a string has all unique characters. *Follow up: no additional buffers allowed.*
6. Implement basic string compression like aabccccaaa -> a2b1c4a3.

#### Search and Sort

1. Binary search
2. Sort an array of strings, so that all the anagrams are next to each other.
3. There are 2 sorted arrays A and B. A has large enough buffer at the end to hold B. 
  Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
4. Bubble sort
5. Insertion sort
6. Merge sort

#### Binary Tree

1. In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversals.
2. Level-order traversal. *Follow up: print nodes level by level, like reverted tree.*
3. Check if a tree is BST
4. Check if a tree is balanced
5. Find the next node (in-order successor) of a given node in a BST. Each node has link to its parent.

#### Linked List

1. Delete node from the middle of a singly-linked list, having access only to that node. 
  Example: node `c` from `a->b->c->d->e->f`
2. Remove duplicates from an unsorted singly-linked list. *Follow up: using no additional buffers*.
3. Check if a linked list is circular.
4. Find the n-th to last element of a singly linked list.
5. Check if a linked list is a palindrome.
